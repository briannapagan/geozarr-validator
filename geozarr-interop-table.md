## Tools

### GDAL (3.8.3) 


### QGIS (3.34.3)
With GDAL (3.8.1) 

Can read from local storage, but can't read the CRS.

Can read from S3, but extremely slowly.

Can write, but with incorrect nodata value and doesn't write multiple variables to a file. 

### ArcGIS (3.2.1) 

### NetCDF Python Library (1.6.2)
Should be able to read from S3, but depends upon configuring the NetCDF C library with [the NCZarr implementation](https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/nug/current/nczarr_head.html) to read from S3. Attempting to read from S3 triggered this message: `s3 scheme requires that netCDF be configured with –enable-nczarr-s3 option `.

### NCO (5.1.9)
Ticket: https://github.com/zarr-developers/geozarr-spec/issues/40

Should be able to read from S3, but depends upon configuring the NetCDF C library with [the NCZarr implementation](https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/nug/current/nczarr_head.html) to read from S3. Attempting to read from S3 triggered this message: `s3 scheme requires that netCDF be configured with –enable-nczarr-s3 option `.

### Panoply (5.2.9)

### Xarray (2024.1.1)
Can read and write, but only if using GDAL <3.6 or no GDAL. Does not work with GDAL 3.8.
